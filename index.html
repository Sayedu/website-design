                ’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at City College of New York. This program has given me a solid foundation in computer science, and I’ve been applying what I’ve learned through practical experiences. I’ve also had the chance to complete the Google Software Engineering Program (G-SWEP), which has helped me further develop my skills and expertise in software engineering.
